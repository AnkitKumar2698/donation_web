            <h2>We Deleiver</h2>
            <p>Access to clean, reliable energy enables farmers and agribusinesses to increase food production and engage in value-added processing. It also allows farmers living in off-grid areas to replace expensive diesel generators with new and cleaner technologies, such as solar food dryers and solar water irrigation. The solar agricultural market is still in the early stages of development and barriers include the relatively high technology costs, limited awareness of the benefits, lack of appropriate policy incentives and limited access to finance for farmers and suppliers to make solar technologies more affordable.

                We support enterprises that adopt, develop and market sustainable, cost-effective solutions for agricultural production, post-harvest and storage processing, including solar pumping, cooling, chilling and drying. These technologies result in saved costs, increased yields and local value capture for farmers or local agro enterprises. Our advice to businesses includes markets entry, product pricing, sales strategies, market assessments, payment solutions, route-to-market strategies and the agricultural value chain.</p>

                India is where it all started for us â€“ where we pioneered, tested and successfully scaled our video-enabled approach to agricultural extension. After spinning off from Microsoft Research in 2008, we worked with all levels of government in over 15,200 villages across India, touching the lives of over 1.9 million smallholder farmers, 90% of them women.
